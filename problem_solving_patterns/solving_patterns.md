# Problem Solving

- Understand the Problem
- Explore concrete examples
- Break it down
- Solve/Simplify
- Review and refactor

## Understand the problem

**Questions to ask:**

- Restate the problem in my own words
- What are the inputs that go into the problem ?
- What are the outputs that should emerge from the problem ?
- Can the outputs be determined from the inputs ? i.e. do we have enough information to solve the problem
- How should I label the important data of the problems ?

## Concrete examples

- Create examples to help understand the problem better
  - Start with a few simple examples
  - Progress to more complex examples
  - Consider empty/null/undefined inputs
  - Consider invalid inputs
- Examples can provide test cases to prove solution works as expected

## Break it down

- Write down (just as simple comments to avoid language syntax) the steps you need to take. Also keeps interviewer informed of the thinking

## Solve or simplify

- Attempt to solve the problem, but if we can't, can we solve a simpler related problem ?
- Identify core difficulty, temporarily ignore it in order to write a simplified solution and then finally incorporate the difficulty back in

## Review and refactor

**Questions to ask:**

- Can the result be checked ?
- Can the result be derived differently ? Rarely one solution...
- Can you understand the solution at a glance ? How intuitive does it look
- Can result/method be used for some other problem ?
- Can you improve the performance of the solution ?
- How have other people solved this problem ?
